# Content: Model Evaluation and Validation
## Project: Predicting Boston Housing Prices

Things I learned by completing this project:

- How to use NumPy to investigate the latent features of a dataset.
- How to analyze various learning performance plots for variance and bias.
- How to determine the best-guess model for predictions from unseen data.
- How to evaluate a model's performance on unseen data using previous data.
