Things I learned by completing this project:

- How to use NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn to investigate the latent features of a dataset.
- How to detect underfitting and overfitting using learning curves
- How to do grid search to find the optimal hyper parameters
- How to  use evaluate a model's performance on unseen data using previous data.
